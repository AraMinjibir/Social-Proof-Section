# Social-Proof-Section

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to enhance my coding skills in the basics of both HTML and CSS. The project showcases a card for a specific company, featuring advertisements of their products, feedback from clients, and the company's overall rating.

The project is divided into two distinct types to cater to different user experiences and provide insights about the company.

### Desktop View Design

This version is tailored for users on desktops and laptops. The design specifications align with the dimensions of desktop screens. The width is set to 1440px (as given by the instructor), the font-family used is 'League Spartan' sans-serif, and the font-weight is consistently set to 400, 500, and 700. The project consists of one container with four children. The first and third children are background containers for the top and bottom, respectively, while the remaining two have their own content.

### Mobile View Design

This version is designed for users on mobile phones. The width is set to 357px (as given by the instructor), and it utilizes the 'League Spartan' sans-serif font-family with font-weight values of 400, 500, and 700. Similar to the desktop view, the project has one container with four children. The first and third children serve as background containers for the top and bottom, while the remaining two contain specific content.
